# Digital-wallet-management-system
Java implementation for the Digital Wallet Management System based on the requirements provided. The code will handle reading inputs, processing transactions, and outputting results in the specified format.
Input Reading:
We use a Scanner to read the input.
Read the number of users, then read each user's ID and balance, storing these in a HashMap.
Transaction Processing:
For each transaction, check if the sender has enough balance and if both user IDs are valid.
Update balances accordingly and record the result ("Success" or "Failure").
Sorting and Output:
Convert the balance map entries to a list and sort it by balance in descending order.
Print the sorted user IDs and their balances.
Edge Cases and Assumptions:
The code assumes that all input data is valid according to the constraints and format given.
Usage
To run this Java program:
Save the code to a file named DigitalWalletManagementSystem.java.
Compile the program using javac DigitalWalletManagementSystem.java.
Run the program using java DigitalWalletManagementSystem and provide the input via standard input (or redirect from a file).
This implementation handles typical edge cases such as insufficient funds and invalid user IDs gracefully.
